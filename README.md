# Do You Know Code?
A simple JavaScript Quiz!
## Description

Hello and welcome to a little JavaScript quiz that I have created to practice using JavaScript and Bootstrap!

DO YOU know Code?

This project created a wonderful opertunity to dip my toes into using local storage as well as continue to build a good foundation of JavaScript knowledge and use. This one took a lot of research to understand what I was needing to accomplish and how to go about doing it. I learned a lot about building out and creating a full working JS file and application that has multiple moving parts and interaction points. Learning how to use the button functions was a breeze, but getting the questions to show on the screen without having them already in the HTML took a good chunk of my attention.

This project was built out in two waves, as I started with the quiz questions and score functionallities before finishing and taking on the leaderboard as its own beast. After having written it, it feels like there are two major features at play here and it was useful to know how to intigrate everything together.

## Usage

To access my quiz please visit: https://sikoticvinyl.github.io/DoYouKnowCode/

Once you are there, you should see this main page welcoming you with a start button at the bottom. Once you click the start button be ready as the timer begins! Answer each question, but be aware for every wrong answer you loose 10 seconds on the clock and miss an oppertunity to score. Once your timer runs out to zero, you will be taken to the completed page. Here you have access to the leaderboard, where you enter your name in the space provided and it will show you your score, time completed as well as your rank. You can take the quiz multiple times to try and beat your scores!
